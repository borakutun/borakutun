Hi there. My name is Bora and I am a freshman at Bilkent University.I am a Computer Science student. I graduated from TED Ankara College and I also have an International Baccalaureate diploma. I love football and basketball and I am a Galatasaray fan. I also love rap/hip-hop music. I like hanging out with my friends and watching movies/TV shows with them.
